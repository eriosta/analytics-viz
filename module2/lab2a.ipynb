    "### About Yahoo Finance Module\n",
    "\n",
    "The Yahoo Finance Module (```yfinance```) gives you access to real-time and historical stock data. To use the Yahoo finance module, you first need to install it. To install the Yahoo Finance Module, run the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install yfinance\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have installed the module, you will need to import it into the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "import yfinance as yf\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Access the functions through ```yf```. You will only be using the ```download()``` function to get the prices for a given stock during a given time span. Remember that The first line is done for you below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "You will do the following\n",
    "1. The starter code has been created for you. Specifically, there is an example of how you will access historical stock data from Yahoo Finance module. Adapt and use this sample code to get the required data for the stocks above. The stock symbols are provided above, which is needed for the ```tickers``` parameter.\n",
    "2. Create a 2D NumPy array which represent the number of shares per stock. Then use the dot product, to find the value of the entire portfolio for each day in May. Create a data frame with the dates and the portfolio values.\n",
    "3. Create a lineplot using seaborn that plots the prices for each stock. The x axis are the days (they can just be days numbered 0 through 20). The y axis is the price of the stocks. HINT: use the ```pd.melt()``` function to reconfigure the ```DataFrame``` so you can plot multiple lines using the ```hue``` parameter in the ```lineplot()``` function. After calling ```pd.melt()```, name the value column ```'Price'``` and the variable (column) name ```'Stock'```.\n",
    "4. Answer the questions below."
