    "<em>Lab 1 consist of three exercises. This is the third of three exercises in Lab 1, which focuses on basic loops and conditionals, functions and passing objects as parameters, dictionaries, and bar chart visualization. </em>\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is to simulate 200000 rounds of a dice version of the children's card game War. The purpose of this simulation is to determine which player has an advantage of based on these rules below. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two players: PLAYER and BANKER. These are just names for the players. Each player has a regular six-sided die. In one round, each player will roll their die and attempt to get the highest value. The rules are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If either player rolls a six, the game stops. The player with the higher die value wins. If both dice values are the same, then it is a tie. \n",
    "- If neither player has a six in the initial roll, then a player may re-roll under these conditions:\n",
    "    - If the BANKER initially rolled a 3 or below, the BANKER will re-roll their die. \n",
    "    - If the PLAYER initially rolled a 2 or below, the PLAYER will re-roll their die.\n",
    "    - After this reroll, the game stops. The player with the higher die value wins. If both dice values are the same, then it is a tie. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The starter code has been created for you. You must use it with the two functions you will write, especially the ```outcomes``` dictionary variable declared for you. \n",
    "2. Complete the ```simulateGames``` function. Simulate the total number of rounds with the rules. Determine the outcome and increase the count on the ```outcomes``` dictionary. Use the ```rollDie``` function included for you for this task.\n",
    "3. Complete the ```visualizeResults``` function. Use the ```seaborn``` ```barplot()``` to visualize the outcomes. \n",
    "4. Function comments have been added for you.\n",
    "5. Answer the questions below. "
