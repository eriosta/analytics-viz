    "## Lab 4B\n",
    "\n",
    "Lab 4 consists of two exercises on reading in data from external CSV and JSON files into Pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will analyze in 2019 data on FIFA soccer players' data. You will read in these data in the ```fifa2019.csv``` CSV file data into a Pandas dataframe. The tasks are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clean the data\n",
    "2. First analysis - Overall rating versus wage\n",
    "3. Second analysis - Overall rating per club\n",
    "4. Third analysis - Distribution of wages in highest waged clubs\n",
    "\n",
    "More information is provided below on each of these tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clean the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Read the ```fifa2019.csv``` capturing only the ```ID```, ```Club```, ```Overall```, ```Wage```, ```Position``` columns into a Pandas dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "Clean the data in the following manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. ```Wage``` is a monetary amount shown in Euros (â‚¬). Wages also include ```K``` to represent thousands of Euros. Remove the ```'K'``` from the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Remove any player who does not belong to a club and any player who makes 0 Euros in ```Wage```. Players that aren't assigned to a club are the same players who make 0 Euros. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ultimately, the ```Overall``` and ```Wage``` should be integers. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### First Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigate the relationship between a player's ```Overall``` rating compared to their ```Wage```. Plot this data as a scatterplot with the x axis representing the ```Overall``` rating and the y axis representing the ```Wage``` (in 100Ks).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Second Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigate the data based on the club in terms of average ```Overall``` rating of all players in that club. Plot these data as a bar graph for the top 10 clubs in terms of average ```Overall``` rating. The x axis will be the ```Club```. The y axis will be the average ```Overall``` in <strong>descending</strong> order, which will help you determine the highest valued teams in terms of their players. \n",
    "\n",
    "This task will require you to group the ```DataFrame``` by ```Club```. You may also need to create a new ```DataFrame``` for to create this plot. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Third Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Investigate the distribution of salaries for the top 10 clubs in terms of average ```Wage```. \n",
    "You may need to create a new ```DataFrame``` to create this plot. Plot these data on scatterplot or stripplot on top of a boxplot to show the distribution of data. The y axis will be the ```Club``` while the x axis will be the ```Wage```. \n",
    "\n",
    "This task will require you to group the ```DataFrame``` by ```Club```. You may also need to create a new ```DataFrame``` for to create this plot. "
