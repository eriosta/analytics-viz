    "## Lab 1B - Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Lab 1 consist of three exercises. This is the second of three exercises in Lab 1, which is on lists, functions, and math functions.</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise will complete the code that will <strong>manually calculate</strong> the average and sample standard deviation within a 2D list. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you must use the variable names listed in the tasks below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Two lists have been declared for you. ```values``` is a 2D list of integer values. You can change the numbers in the ```values```, but the solution provided below is for the default numbers provided in the notebook template. ```results``` is a 2D list consisting of the average and sample standard deviation for each row in the ```values``` list. For example, the first row in  ```results``` will have the average and sample standard deviation for the first row in ```values```. To start,  ```results``` is an empty list.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. ```getAverage``` is a function that takes in a list of values as its parameter ```mylist```. ```mylist``` is intended to be a row within a 2D list of integers for this program. The function will compute the average and return it. Most of this function has been completed for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Complete the ```getStandardDeviation``` function. It takes in a list of values as its parameter ```mylist```. The function will need to call ```getAverage```. The function will compute the standard deviation and return it. If the length of the list is less than 2, return a -999 in it. The formula for the sample standard deviation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "\\sqrt{ \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{N} ( x_{i} - \\bar{x} )^2}{N-1} }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Complete the ```getResults``` function. It takes in a 2D list of integers  ```data_list``` and an empty list  ```stat_results``` as its parameters. The function will go through each sub-list in ```data_list``` and get the average and the standard deviation and append it to the ```stat_results``` list. ```stat_results``` will be a 2D list with each sub-list including two elements: average and standard deviation for the corresponding sub-list in ```data_list```. See below for an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Function comments have been added for you."
