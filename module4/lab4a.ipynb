    "\n",
    "Lab 4 consist of two exercises. This is the first exercise will cover JSON as well as some string processing, ```DataFrame```s, and plotting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will write a program that reads an external JSON file and you will also visualize some of the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the JSON File\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON file ```prize.json``` contains data about nobel prizes retrieved from github.com.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tasks \n",
    "\n",
    "You will do the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the file as a JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Traverse the JSON and extract the following data and add this data to a ```DataFrame``` with the following columns:\n",
    "    * Year\n",
    "    * Category\n",
    "    * Number of people who share a prize\n",
    "    * Watch out: sometimes several people share one prize.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Traverse the data frame to find the number of total given nobel prizes in the different categories and show the result in a new data frame\n",
    "    * Display the data in a new DataFrame\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Traverse the data frame from task 2 to find the average number people who share a prize in the different categorieso\n",
    "    * Display the data in a new DataFrame\n",
    "    * use panda's groupby operation and mean method for this task\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Plot the following graphs with the average number of people sharing a nobel prize in the different categories\n",
    "     * bar plot (for the past 20 years)\n",
    "     * box plot for the entire time frame\n",
    "     * experiment with color palettes and styles of the graphs and create a second pair of the above graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Answer the question below."
