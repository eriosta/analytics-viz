    "## Lab 6B\n",
    "\n",
    "<em>Lab 6 consists of two exercises on natural language processing through conducting a sentiment analysis on text data and social media.</em>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will download a set of tweets from Twitter based on a trending hashtag and conduct a sentiment analysis on the tweets and plot the average sentiment over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will download the tweets and save it into a CSV file for further analysis. Saving the tweets into a CSV file saves you from having to connect to Twitter each time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download 2000 original tweets that have a trending hashtag of your choice and save the tweets in a CSV file. Do not include retweets. You should select a popular hashtags that many people include repeatedly. <em>This may take several minutes to complete.</em>\n",
    "2. Save the following information from the Tweet object into a CSV file: datetime, user's screen name, text, mentions (other users the tweet includes), and the hashtags in the text. For the mentions and hashtags, you may need to parse these out of the JSON object before saving it into the CSV file. The hashtag list will usually include the original hashtag you searched for, so do not include it in the CSV file. <em>HINT: Save all usernames, mentions, and hashtags as completely lower-cased strings. This will help you when you are counting the number of occurrences.</em>\n",
    "3. Determine who was the most active Twitter user during this time frame in terms of the number of posts.\n",
    "4. Calculate the average polarity and subjectivity for all tweets in your data set.\n",
    "5. Conduct a social network analysis of the users in the data set. Users are connected by user mentions. There is a directional edge from a user who mentions another user in their tweet. Find the user with the highest in-degree centrality and the highest out-degree centrality. There is no need to visualize the social network as there would be too many nodes. \n",
    "7. Answer the questions below. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**\n",
    "\n",
    "When working on this exercise, you will use your own Twitter authentication information. After you have completed the exercise, delete this information. The grader will replace it with their own keys for grading and testing. This information should not be shared with others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Submit CSV**\n",
    "\n",
    "Submit your CSV file. It will be used for testing your lab and grading. \n"

With respect to the reasons, factors that influence sentiment analysis results include tone and language, context, sampling bias, and ambiguity. Positive language and a promotional context tend to yield positive sentiment scores, while negative language and critical contexts tend to yield negative scores. Sampling bias and ambiguous language can also affect sentiment analysis.\n",
